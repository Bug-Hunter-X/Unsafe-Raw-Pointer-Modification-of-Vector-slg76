# Unsafe Raw Pointer Modification of Vector in Rust
This example shows the risk of using raw pointers with vectors in Rust and how to avoid common pitfalls that may lead to undefined behavior.
The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the error, while the `bugSolution.rs` file presents a safer approach to manipulating vector contents.  Always prioritize safe Rust practices when working with vectors and other data structures.
